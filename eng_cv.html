          <p>
          As a 24-year IT veteran with deep experience in both Japanese and Western business cultures, I’ve developed a unique perspective on technology's role in bridging organizational needs and cultural nuance. My philosophy is grounded in two core principles: use the right tool for the job, and become a better creator by being a discerning, enthusiastic software consumer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working with major Japanese financial institutions and global firms, I’ve seen how cultural values shape IT practices. Japan excels in hardware innovation and information curation, yet the overreliance on tools like Excel—what I call the “Excel Craftsman” culture—often stifles scalability and clarity. I advocate for purpose-built tools: relational databases like PostgreSQL for complex data, Visio Professional for clear documentation, and modern platforms that reduce technical debt.
          </p>
          <p>
           My belief is simple: you can't build great software if you haven't used great software. Just as great writers read deeply, technologists must explore and evaluate top-tier tools. This mindset has fueled my success across diverse projects—from ServiceNow implementations and blockchain logistics to Olympic infrastructure and financial system modernization.
          </p>
          <p>
           With experience in both Japan and the U.S., I bridge the visual, context-sensitive thinking prevalent in Japanese organizations with the Western emphasis on abstraction and separation of concerns. On a recent multi-year core banking overhaul at MUFG, I contributed as a project manager during the final phase of the initiative. I’ve also served as a business analyst auditing AML safeguards across a bank’s IT ecosystem—gaining insight into the intersection of regulatory needs and systemic design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, I believe great software design transcends cultural boundaries. By consuming technology thoughtfully and designing systems that honor the natural shape of information, I help teams move beyond legacy constraints toward true digital transformation.

              <b>April 2023 - January 2024:</b> Participated in a project to
              migrate an in-house asset management solution to ServiceNow's ITAM
              module. Defined requirements, configured the ServiceNow solution,
              and ensured it aligned with the client's needs. Evaluated the use
              of out-of-the-box functionality versus customization to optimize
              the solution.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>March 2024:</b> Completed a three-week project to automate
              security risk assessments. Integrated the Panorays API with the
              ServiceNow platform to enable real-time visibility into the
              client's security posture. Gathered and documented project
              requirements and coordinated project tasks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>April - August 2024:</b> Led the development and migration of a
              blockchain-based supply chain management solution on the
              ServiceNow platform. This was a portal-based application
              leveraging the ServiceNow platform. Managed all project phases,
              including requirements, design, development, testing, and
              deployment. The solution enhanced supply chain transparency and
              security by enabling product tracking and provenance verification.
              Managed ongoing development based on user feedback.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>September - October 2024:</b> Led the preparation of this
              solution for release as a commercial plugin on the ServiceNow
              Marketplace. This included ensuring compliance with marketplace
              guidelines, documenting the solution, and creating supporting
              materials.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Throughout these projects I collaborated closely with clients to
            understand their needs and ensure successful outcomes. Utilized
            Agile development methodologies to deliver solutions quickly and
            efficiently. Built solutions using both no-code/low-code and custom
            development techniques within the ServiceNow platform. Managed
            development and production environments to ensure system stability.
            Also provided technical guidance and mentorship to junior team
            members.

              From 2013-2019, in partial overlap with contracted positions I
              held at various Japanese banks, I managed a business liquidation
