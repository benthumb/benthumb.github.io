        <h2>Professional Interests</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p></p>
            <p>      As a 24-year IT veteran with deep experience in both Japanese and Western business cultures, I&rsquo;ve developed a unique perspective on technology's role in bridging organizational needs and cultural nuance. My philosophy is grounded in two core principles: use the right tool for the job, and become a better creator by being a discerning, enthusiastic software consumer.</p>
            <p>      Working with major Japanese financial institutions and global firms, I&rsquo;ve seen how cultural values shape IT practices. Japan excels in hardware innovation and information curation, yet the overreliance on tools like Excel&mdash;what I call the &ldquo;Excel Craftsman&rdquo; culture&mdash;often stifles scalability and clarity. I advocate for purpose-built tools: relational databases like PostgreSQL for complex data, Visio Professional for clear documentation, and modern platforms that reduce technical debt.</p>
            <p>      My belief is simple: you can't build great software if you haven't used great software. Just as great writers read deeply, technologists must explore and evaluate top-tier tools. This mindset has fueled my success across diverse projects&mdash;from ServiceNow implementations and blockchain logistics to Olympic infrastructure and financial system modernization.</p>
            <p>      With experience in both Japan and the U.S., I bridge the visual, context-sensitive thinking prevalent in Japanese organizations with the Western emphasis on abstraction and separation of concerns. On a recent multi-year core banking overhaul at MUFG, I contributed as a project manager during the final phase of the initiative. I&rsquo;ve also served as a business analyst auditing AML safeguards across a bank&rsquo;s IT ecosystem&mdash;gaining insight into the intersection of regulatory needs and systemic design.</p>
            <p>      Ultimately, I believe great software design transcends cultural boundaries. By consuming technology thoughtfully and designing systems that honor the natural shape of information, I help teams move beyond legacy constraints toward true digital transformation.</p>
